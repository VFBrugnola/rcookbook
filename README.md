## BBC R graphics cookbook

This repo is home to the BBC Visual Journalism data team's R graphics cookbook. It includes instructions on installing [`bbplot`](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), the R package that we have created to produce and export ggplot2 charts in our in-house style. 

The cookbook is available at this link:
